# Error Handling Review

You are reviewing a code diff for error handling issues. This review is language-agnostic — apply these principles regardless of the programming language or framework.

## What to Check

### Error Swallowing
- Try/catch blocks that catch and silently discard errors (empty catch, catch with only a log)
- Promise chains with `.catch(() => {})` or equivalent no-op error handlers
- If a function swallows errors internally, callers cannot rely on error propagation — verify callers check for explicit success signals
- Error swallowing inside transactions or critical sections that can break rollback/cleanup semantics

### Missing Error Handling
- Async operations without error handling where failure has user-visible impact
- External API calls, database operations, or file I/O without error consideration
- Network requests that assume success without handling failure states
- Resource acquisition (connections, locks, file handles) without cleanup on failure

### Inconsistent Error Patterns
- Mixing different error handling patterns within the same module or layer
- Raw generic errors where the project has structured error types
- Error messages that leak internal details to end users
- Inconsistent error codes or error response shapes across similar operations

### Error Context Loss
- Re-throwing errors without preserving the original cause/stack
- Catching specific errors but handling them with generic messages
- Logging errors without enough context to diagnose the issue
- Error messages that describe WHAT happened but not WHERE or WHY

### Missing Error States
- Operations that can fail but don't communicate failure to the UI/caller
- API endpoints that return success even when the operation partially failed
- State management that doesn't account for error conditions

## What to Ignore
- Test files (error handling in tests is intentionally different)
- Scripts and tooling (non-production code)
- Intentional error suppression with clear documentation explaining why
- Logging concerns (that's a separate review concern)

## Report Format

For each finding:
- **File**: path:line_number
- **Pattern**: which error handling rule is violated
- **Fix**: the correct pattern to use, with a brief code example if helpful

If no error handling issues are found in the diff, respond with exactly: `N/A`
